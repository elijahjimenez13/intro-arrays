1) Arrays:
An array is a special variable having one name, but storing a list of data items,
with each item being directly accessible. Some languages use a construct similar
to an array called a vector.

2) Element:
Each item in an array is known as an element.

3) Index:
In an array access, then number in brackets is called the index of that element. 
In Coral, the first array element is at index 0.

4) Logical Error:

Logic errors occur when there is a fault in the logic or structure of the problem. 
Logic errors do not usually cause a program to crash. However, logic errors can 
cause a program to produce unexpected results.
